- create matter_pdf(self) class 
- move all functions in pyLDT into matter_pdf class as methods
- in example.ipynb instantiate mPDF object as pyLDT.matter_pdf()
- compute pdf as mPDF.compute_pdf(...)
- Have a look at pyreact to get an idea of the steps and functions involved 
- Change pytest accordingly
